Extension Template
==================

> [!NOTE]
> This template is used for localstack CLI versions <= 3.6.0. For later version see https://github.com/localstack/localstack-extensions/tree/main/templates

This is a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template that is used when you invoke.

```console
localstack extensions dev new
```

It contains a simple python distribution config, and some boilerplate extension code.
