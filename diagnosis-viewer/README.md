View the diagnostics endpoint directly in localstack

## Access Diagnosis Data

The extension is a web UI for the diagnosis endpoint of LocalStack, which is enabled when LocalStack is started with `DEBUG=1` and available at `curl -s localhost:4566/_localstack/diagnose`.
The web UI can then be reached at `http://localhost:4566/diapretty`.


## Installation

Install the extension by running:

```bash
localstack extensions install localstack-extension-diagnosis-viewer
```

## Development

### Install local development version

To install the extension into localstack in developer mode, you will need Python 3.10, and create a virtual environment in the extensions project.

In the newly generated project, simply run

```bash
make install
```

Then, to enable the extension for LocalStack, run

```bash
localstack extensions dev enable .
```

You can then start LocalStack with `EXTENSION_DEV_MODE=1` to load all enabled extensions.
Make sure to also set `DEBUG=1` so the diagnose endpoint necessary to populate the report is loaded.

```bash
EXTENSION_DEV_MODE=1 DEBUG=1 localstack start
```
