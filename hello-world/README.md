Hello World LocalStack extension
================================

A minimal LocalStack extension.

## Installing

```bash
localstack extensions install "git+https://github.com/localstack/localstack-extensions/#egg=localstack-extension-hello-world&subdirectory=hello-world"
```

## What does it do?

It just prints a message to stdout once LocalStack starts, and a second time once the platform is ready to serve requests.
