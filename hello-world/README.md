Hello World LocalStack extension
================================

A minimal LocalStack extension.

## What does it do?

It just prints a message to stdout once LocalStack starts, and a second time once the platform is ready to serve requests.

## Installing

```bash
localstack extensions install localstack-extension-hello-world
```
